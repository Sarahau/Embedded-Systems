M5 Stack Core2 device projects written in C++ utilizing Arduino libraries

### Weather Program v1
HTTP API get request to get the weather based on a zipcode

### Weather Program v2
Use VCNL4040 and SHT40 sensors to read local temperature and humidity using I2C protocol 

### Weather Program v3
Use Google Cloud Functions to upload the data to Google Firestore and calculate the average sensor readings

### Whack-A-Mole
Bluetooth game between two M5 Stack Core2 devices that run as either a server or client, each alternating between sending and reading data

### a-MAZE-ing
A new take on an old classic: tilt the M5 Stack Core2 to move the hat through a maze map filled with obstacles. These obstacles need to be melted (SHT40) or bloomed with light (VCNL4040)
